# Code-Generation-Model-using-LLMs
A code generation model is a type of artificial intelligence that can automatically generate source code based on a given input, which can be natural language instructions, existing code snippets, or structured data. So, if you want to learn how to build a code generation model using LLMs, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through the task of building a code generation model with LLMs using Python.
# How to Build a Code Generation Model using LLMs?
To build a code generation model using Large Language Models (LLMs), we can start by collecting a large, diverse dataset of code examples and related documentation from various programming languages. Then, preprocess this data to ensure quality and consistency. In the end, fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-4 or any appropriate LLM, on the dataset to specialize it in understanding and generating code.

So, to build a code generation model using LLMs, we need a lot of data on code snippets. We can collect code snippets from GitHub by using the GitHub API. So, before proceeding with the task of building a code generation model, I recommend you sign up for the GitHub API and get your access token. Here’s the process you can follow:


   - Go to GitHub Settings.
   - Click on “Generate new token”.
    - Select the necessary scopes (at least repo scope to access repositories).
    - Generate the token and copy it.

# Code Generation Model using LLMs
Now, let’s get started with the task of building a Code Generation model using LLMs. Before proceeding, here are the commands to install some of the libraries you will be using for the first time if it’s your first time using LLMs:

  - pip install transformers datasets
   - pip install transformers[torch] accelerate -U

And, as we are using GitHub in this task to collect code snippets, run this command as well in your command prompt before getting started:

   - pip install PyGithub datasets
